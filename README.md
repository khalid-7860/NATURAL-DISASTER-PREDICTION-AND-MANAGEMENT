🌪️ Natural Disaster Prediction and Management Using AI
This project leverages artificial intelligence, satellite data, and real-time sensor networks to predict and manage natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones. By integrating early warning systems, predictive modeling, and emergency response tools, the system helps minimize human and economic loss through timely alerts and informed decision-making.

📌 Features
📡 Real-time data collection from weather APIs and IoT sensors
🧠 AI/ML-based prediction of disasters like floods, storms, and earthquakes
🗺️ Risk mapping with geospatial and population data
📢 Early warning and automated alert system
📊 Interactive dashboards for monitoring, analysis, and response coordination
🚨 Emergency resource planning and crisis management tools

🔧 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas / NumPy / Scikit-learn / XGBoost (for analytics and ML)
TensorFlow / LSTM / Random Forest (for time series and classification models)
GeoPandas / QGIS / Folium (for mapping and spatial analysis)
Flask / Streamlit (for web interface and alert dashboards)
APIs: OpenWeatherMap, NASA Earthdata, USGS, IMD (for real-time data)
PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for data storage)

📍 How It Works

🔸 Data Collection: Gather live data from weather APIs, satellites, seismographs, and local sensors.
🔸 Disaster Prediction: Use ML models to forecast natural disasters based on environmental patterns.
🔸 Risk Assessment: Combine predictions with geographic and demographic data to determine vulnerable zones.
🔸 Early Warning: Generate and send automated alerts to government agencies and the public.
🔸 Response Coordination: Visualize active threats and suggest emergency response plans and resource deployment.
🔸 Post-Disaster Analysis: Collect impact data for future learning, reporting, and resilience improvement.
